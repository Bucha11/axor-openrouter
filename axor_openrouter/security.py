"""
Composition root for axor-core's neutral "session tap" observers.

axor-core exposes two read-only seams on ``GovernedSession`` — a ``ContextTap``
that receives a ``SessionContextView`` per turn, and a ``SessionSink`` that
receives a ``SessionAuditRecord`` on session close. The security observers that
drive those seams (axor-probe's ``CoreContextTap`` and axor-sentinel's
``CoreSessionSink``) live in sibling packages. THIS adapter is where they get
wired into the session core builds — it is the composition root.

Invariant P-34 is preserved here:

  * axor-probe and axor-sentinel are OPTIONAL dependencies (the ``[security]``
    extra). The base adapter declares only ``axor-core`` (plus httpx), so
    importing axor_openrouter never drags in probe/sentinel.
  * Their imports are LAZY — performed inside ``build_observers`` only when the
    caller explicitly opts in — so a base install with neither package present
    keeps working untouched.
  * There is no dependency cycle: axor-probe and axor-sentinel depend only on
    axor-core (structurally, under TYPE_CHECKING), never on this adapter. The
    adapter depends on them; they never depend back.
